What is database normalization?
Ans: It is a process of analyzing the given relation schemas based on their functional dependencies and primary keys to achieve the following desirable properties:
1) Minimizing Redundancy
2) Minimizing the Insertion, Deletion, And Update Anomalies

Denormalization
store redundant data if the query has been repeated often and commonly used to create higly scalable systems
avoid costly join in a relational database
cons
update and inserts are more expensive
data maybe inconsistent
data redundancy requires more storage
pros
query data is faster and quicker

JOINs
INNER JOIN - the result set contains only the data where the criteria match
OUTER JOIN - contains some records that have no matching record
    LEFT OUTER JOIN - contains all the records from the left table
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN - contains all the records from the right table
    FULL OUTER JOIN - all the records from all the tables

 Define database model.
A data model determining fundamentally how data can be stored, manipulated and organised and the structure of the database logically is called database model.
